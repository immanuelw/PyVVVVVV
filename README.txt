This project is a recreation of the first level of VVVVVV (a game that was created for windows and ported to multiple gaming platforms)
Created entirely in python and pygame.
I used someone's basic outline of how to create this game and heavily expanded upon it to implement 
many features from the original game; although some bugs still exist.

test_env.py: the test program
VVVVVV.py used to run the game

data folder contains the various sprites and background images; and also music used when running the game.

Requires python2.7 and pygame to run. As well as some other audio programs(which will be prompted upon running)

The controls are simple using the arrows:
	left and right make the character go left or right.
	up, down, or space reverses the character's gravity
That's it!

Checkpoints are your friend. Don't forget to touch them.
