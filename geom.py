Py6V -- Pythonic VVVVVV
geom -- Geometry

Defines the Geometry class.

Because of our simplistic world, a Geometry is a region defined by a collection
of rectangles. At any time another rectangle can be tested against it, and it
will return a dict mapping a HIT* constant to the tuple (penetration, rect),
such that if the rectangle is moved by penetration pixels to the opposite
direction (e.g. right for HITLEFT), the rectangle will no longer be inside (but
will be flush with) the surface. If two opposing sides are penetrating, there is
no way the rectangle can fit into the geometry. The rect itself is returned so
that any attributes stored on it may be accessed. An entry (0, None) represents
no hit on that axis.
